# Changelog

## 4.0.0

First public release. Version continues from the private predecessor (forge 3.3.0).

### Changed

- Project renamed to **my-poor-ai**; plugin name, command namespace (`/my-poor-ai:*`), and skill namespace updated accordingly
- README rewritten in English; manifests carry English descriptions
- Open-contribution policy: external issues/PRs welcome (CONTRIBUTING.md, issue/PR templates, SECURITY.md)
- All Korean documentation unified to noun-ending sentence style (명사형 종결), including generated-artifact style rules

### Added

- `/my-poor-ai:roles` — role-preset entry points (architect / builder / debugger / reviewer / docs)
- `scripts/generate-codex-agents.mjs` — `.codex/agents/*.toml` auto-generated from `agents/*.md` (single source of truth), with `--check` drift gate in CI
- SKILL frontmatter descriptions in English for reliable skill triggering in English-language sessions
- `docs/recommended-mcp.md` — recommended MCP server pairings

### Removed

- Dead content: `feature-dev` skill (absorbed by using-my-poor-ai FULL path + feature-pipeline), legacy `run-hook.cmd`, superseded document-reviewer prompt templates
